The game works similarly to the guess a number game. The difference is you are
instead guessing the face value on a playing card.

There is no suits implemented. Only the value on the face of the card.

You are guessing between 2 and Ace, while aces are the high card.

// update

Added random card selector, set value of answer = to random and have the prompt continue over and over until the correct card is selected.

referenced Jacob Relkin from Stackoverflow on random selector code.
